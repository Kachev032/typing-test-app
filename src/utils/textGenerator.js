  "The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves. You can't be told what the future holds, but you can choose your own path. That is the only true freedom you have. Make it count.",

  "The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places. But still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater. And that is what makes it worth living for.",
